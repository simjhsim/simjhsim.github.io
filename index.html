          <b style="font-size:25px">About:</b><br><br>
          I am a PhD candidate and a Teaching Fellow in
          the Department of Mathematics at Boston 
          University. My advisor is Glenn Stevens. 
	  I completed my B.A. in mathematics
          with a minor in computer science at the 
          University of Chicago.<br><br>

          I am interested in number theory with an
          inclination towards algebraic number theory.
	  More specifically, I am interested in Stark's
	  Conjectures, rigid cocycles, Hilbert's 12th Problem,
	  and the relationship between these topics and Kato's 
	  Euler System. <br><br>

	  I am deeply interested in experimenting with ungrading
	  in my classrooms. I have successfully implemented an
	  ungrading structure while teaching linear algebra and
	  elementary number theory. I believe that teaching is an
	  exercise in empathy and empowering students with skills
	  that reach beyond the contents of a course. <br> <br>
          
          You can find me in my office at Boston University's CDS 536 
	  and you can reach me via email at simjhsim [at] bu.edu.
