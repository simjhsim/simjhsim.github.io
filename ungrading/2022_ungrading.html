    <h1> Ungrading for the First Time </h1>
    <p>
        In the summer of 2022, I had the pleasure of teaching Boston University's
	Linear Algebra course (MA 242). As linear algebra is a favorite topic
	of mine and BU's summer courses have little oversight for graduate student
	instructors, I found myself in an ideal opportunity to try my hand at 
	ungrading. Debra Borkovitz had exposed me to the world of alternative
	assessment in the previous semester and I had since found myself gravitating
	toward the idea of stripping away grades from the classroom to accentuate
	learning. Ungrading (also known as self-assessment) and the specific issues
	it seeks to address especially resonated with my frustrations both as an
	instructor and as a student. 

	While the preparation for the course was quite stressful at times, I
	absolutely loved every day of teaching and I cannot undersell the positive
	effect ungrading had on my students. Below is a somewhat detailed description
	of how I set up my course, my reasoning for each component, and some reflections
	as an instructor.
    </p>

    <h3> Philosophy and Goals in Structure </h3>
    <p>
        Before dumping the details of implementation, I think it will be helpful
	to denote my personal philosophy and goals in teaching. The two guiding
	principles I had in mind was to respect students' personal timeline in
	learning, to minimize the stigma of grades, and to promote self-awareness.<br><br>

	Each student has their own timeline in learning. While courses provide 
	a framework for the collective, there is sure to be massive individual
	variance in the speed with which course material fully sinks in. By avoiding
	grades until the very end, students have room to invest their time by
	reflecting on their strengths and weaknesses without the jeopardy of
	losing points in the long run. <br><br>

	The added benefit of eliminating regular grading is the removal of 
	labels on student work. I grew up in a household that stressed the
	importance of doing well academically. While there were some benefits
	to this environment, my biggest regret in my earlier schooling is the
	tunnel-vision I adopted in getting the highest possible grade. This
	had side-tracked any true learning and incentivized shortcuts and
	strategies to game the academic system. Furthermore, getting 
	suboptimal grades on assignments had massive effects on my psyche 
	and hindered me from taking productive steps to address why I had
	gotten said grade. While grades are often seen as a way to help students
	gain context for their progress, my experience on the opposite end of
	grades leads me to believe the negative effect of regular grades 
	actively undermine the positive effects they could have. <br><br>

	Lastly, my main goal in this course was to impart self-awareness in 
	students, both academically and socially. If a student walked out of 
	my class and forgot all the material but retained the ability of 
	assess their own understanding and progress, I would consider my job
	a massive success. (Though, the mathematician in me would be slightly
	sad.) While courses serve to impart certain skills and concepts, in
	reality, most of these skills can be done by computers in this day
	and age. Especially for a topic like linear algebra, the vast majority
	of students will never run calculations by hand once the course is
	over (and in some sense, they shouldn't). In response, I wanted to shift
	the focus of the class toward conceptual understanding of the theory 
	and ideas underlying linear algebra. <br><br>

	On paper, this steers further away from practicality. However, this
	brought a new air to the classroom since a course on theory meant
	discourse and discussions. My class needed to provide a space for
	students to formulate and verbalize their understanding and synthesize
	the material to and with their peers. I wanted to create an environment
	where students can constantly analyze their own understanding and ask
	questions to their peers and myself to further explore the topics at
	hand. As displayed below, my approach for this was to put self-reflection
	at the center of the classroom and challenge my students to stress-test
	their ideas. Especially with the absence of grades, I found that students
	had the room to be wrong and the peace to be unashamed of their errors.
	Instead of hiding their mistakes from me and their peers, everyone could
	air out their confusions and take appropriate steps to gain better and deeper
	understanding. <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3> Assignments </h3>
    <p> 
        There were two assignments each week: Problem Sets and Reflections.
	<b>Problem</b> sets were traditional lists of exercises pertaining to the
	week's material. Most of these were taken from the book, but I always
	included a few extra problems which were more abstract and verging on 
	concepts outside the scope of the class. However, these problems were
	optional. <br><br>

	For submitted problems, I did not provide letter, numerical, nor symbolic
	grades; I only provided feedback. This was to reflect studies which have
	shown that grades on individual assignments steered students away from
	reading any feedback by pulling the focus towards the provided label.
	Explicitly, I tried not to provide solutions and instead pointed out errors
	or provided leading questions to steer students towards identifying 
	their own misunderstandings. In general, I did not emphasize any minor
	calculation errors as long as the errors did not allude to a lapse in
	understanding. <br><br>

	<b>Reflections</b> were free-form write-ups meant for students to reflect on
	the week's material and their progress in the class. The rough guideline
	I provided was to address three things in each write-up. The first was
	to respond to my feedback on the previous week's problem set. Students tended
	to list out what their errors were and either provide corrections along with
	why they had made a mistake or ask questions regarding the feedback with 
	their understanding of what was incorrect. The second guideline was to
	address feedback for previous reflections. These served to continue the
	conversation from earlier reflections. The third was to provide any
	revelations, connections, or corrections the students made in the past week.
	This facet of reflections was the true core of meta-cognition in the course.
	It served to give students a chance to piece previous material together
	and verbalize the progress they were constantly making. Especially since
	class usually ended with challenging problems, I noticed that students
	would regularly solve problems they had previously given up on to
	demonstrate their newfound understanding.
    </p>
    <h3> Lectures </h3>
    <p>
        It feels like a misnomer to call my classes lectures. Each session usually
	started with a warm-up activity. These would serve multiple purposes
	such as review of previous material, computational practice, and/or 
	reframing of established material. Most importantly, though, I would include
	a teaser for the day's topic. For example, I would have students do two
	seemingly different computations which give the exact same answer. The
	students would then be asked to make some predictions about why this phenomenon
	is taking place. My usual template in creating these activities was to
	ask students to create a vector from a random choice of numbers (perhaps
	with restrictions to avoid complications) and to copy down their 
	neighboring classmate's vector. By using these two vectors as the seed
	for problems, students could compare their calculations and end up working
	together in troubleshooting and discussing. <br><br>

	After the warm-up activity, I usually lectured for about an hour to 
	relay the actual material of the day. My personal approach to these
	monologues was to start from extremely natural and simple questions.
	For example, to arrive at the concept of a determinant, I started with
	a quick review of linear independence of vectors and bases. To address
	the question of detecting when a collection of vectors form a basis,
	I steered the discussion towards a geometric approach which led to
	the concept of a parallel piped. To find the volume of this piped,
	I had to introduce a way to finding heights via dot products. I then asked
	students to try finding the area of the piped formed by two vectors in
	R^2 which organically created the determinant of 2x2 matrices. The
	rest of the lecture was exploring what we can determine (pun unintended)
	from this new concept and tying everything back to the question of 
	detecting a basis. This created a natural narrative for students to
	follow and appreciate. Furthermore, by encouraging students to think 
	about these concepts as stories arising from the simplest or 
	pre-established concepts in the course, I found that students gained
	a level of literacy and perspective that a traditional list of facts
	could not hope to impart.<br><br>

	To close each session off, I put a rather difficult problem on the board
	that the students were encouraged to work on together. Sometimes, these
	problems were asking students to recreate a calculation I had performed
	during the lecture, but often, I would try to pose these problems in a
	slightly removed fashion. As an example, after covering a change of basis,
	I asked students to find me a matrix that will rotate R^3 90 degrees about
	the line x=y=z. We had covered what rotations would look like about a
	coordinate axis in a previous class, but the idea was for students to
	synthesize their understanding of bases, geometric transformations, and
	change of bases to solve this problem. While many students were dumbfounded
	by the challenge at first, over the course of 30 minutes, after much
	discussions among smaller groups and experimentation, many students were
	well on their way to solving the problem. These problems also had the
	added benefit of making everybody lost. While this may sound bad on paper,
	it helped foster the idea that everybody in the class had room to grow.
	Even if some students were more outspoken during lectures or had less
	feedback on their assignments, these problems provided a common ground
	of perplexity. <br><br>

	One thing I should mention regarding the closing problems is the 
	frustration students had in not being able to immediately solve problems.
	To make sure students felt validated in their frustrations, I always
	made sure to include a comment or two about difficult problems. Namely,
	if a problem was complicated, I gave the disclaimer that it probably 
	won't be a simple calculation. Another strategy I implemented was to
	jolt the students away from getting lost. I find it extremely easy
	to lose oneself in calculations, so when most students were looking
	lost or defeated, I asked everyone to put down their writing utensils,
	find a partner or two, and discuss their ideas without writing anything
	down. This had the effect of students taking students out of the
	microcosym of their own minds to verbalize and listen to an external
	party. While students quickly returned to their own calculations,
	I've noticed the general confidence growing after these small jolting
	exercises.
    </p>
    <h3> Assessment </h3>
    <p>
        Ideally, I would not have assigned any letter grade at the end of the
	course, but the university required this of me. To provide this letter
	grade, I implemented two conferences to reflect and discuss progress
	with students. [FINISH]

    <h2> My Reflections </h2>
    <p> 
        All in all, my experience with ungrading this summer was been absolutely
	fantastic.
